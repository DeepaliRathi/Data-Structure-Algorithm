/* 
Given a non-negative integer N. 
Reverse the bits of N and print the number obtained after reversing the bits.

Note: The actual binary representation of the number is being considered,
for reversing the bits. No leading 0’s, are being considered.
Constraint:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
Example 1:
Input: 
11
Output:
13
Explanation:
(11)10 = (1011)2.
After reversing the bits we get:
(1101)2 = (13)10.
Example 2:
Input: 
10
Output:
5
Explanation:
(10)10 = (1010)2.
After reversing the bits we get:
(0101)2 = (101)2 = (5)10.
